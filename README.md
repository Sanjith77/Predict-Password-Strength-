# Predict-Password-Strength-

# Overview 
The task of predicting password strength involves building a model that can classify passwords based on their strengthâ€”typically as weak, medium, or strong. The strength of a password is determined by various factors, including its length, character variety (e.g., the inclusion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters), and patterns that may or may not make it vulnerable to attacks.


# Here's a general description of it:

1. Data Collection:
Password Dataset: The dataset may contain passwords and their corresponding strength labels.
Labels:
Weak: Passwords that are easy to guess or crack (e.g., "password", "1234").
Medium: Passwords with moderate complexity but potentially still guessable.
Strong: Passwords that are complex, long, and contain a variety of characters.

2. Feature Extraction:
Length: The longer the password, the stronger it tends to be.
Character Variety: A mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters is a strong indicator of a strong password.
Count of uppercase letters.
Count of lowercase letters.
Count of digits.
Presence of special characters (e.g., @, !, #).
Dictionary-based words: Check if a password contains common words from a dictionary.
Sequential Patterns: Check if there are easily predictable sequences like "1234", "abcd", or patterns on the keyboard (e.g., "qwerty").
Entropy: A measure of unpredictability or randomness in the password.

3. Data Preprocessing:
Cleaning the Data: Remove duplicates and handle any missing or corrupt data.
Normalization: Normalize features like length or counts to standardize the dataset.

4. Modeling:
Classification Algorithm: Use machine learning models to predict password strength. Possible models include:
Logistic Regression: For simple linear classification.
Decision Trees or Random Forests: For non-linear relationships between features.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): To separate the password classes effectively in a high-dimensional space.
Neural Networks: Can capture more complex patterns in the password structure.
Cross-validation: Split the data into training and testing sets to validate the model.

5. Evaluation:
Accuracy: How many passwords were classified correctly?
Precision, Recall, F1-score: To evaluate the performance of the model, especially in imbalanced datasets.
Confusion Matrix: To see how well the model performs in each class (weak, medium, strong).
